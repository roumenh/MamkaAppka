App for my mum as a gift.

**this project is still in build, contains things that will need some refreshment**

This consist of two parts:
- Android
- PHP

Android part is fetching data (JSON) using Retrofit from a webhosting - list of Photos for Days. Each day has a photo and some text. The point of the app is to
1. display every day new photo (assigned for that day)
2. allow to browse in history (fetch all past photos and quotes)

PHP part is to upload a file to a server with specific date and time. It is quite basic but downscaling is included.
There is also api.php that serves with JSON responses for the Android apps.
